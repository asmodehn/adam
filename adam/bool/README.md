A simple representation of the boolean type as a category.

Category Representation : 
- Objects are directories, where each directory is the representation of a category
- Morphisms are files, containing one or more implementation of the morphism, using existing objects and morphisms

Boolean Category, for classical logic, we have two objects (values) : T and F, and one isomorphism : not
