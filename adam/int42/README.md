A simple representation of the integer type (circular, up to 42) as a category.

Category Representation : 
- Objects are directories, where each directory is the representation of a category
- Morphisms are files, containing one or more implementation of the morphism, using existing objects and morphisms

Integer >= 42 Category, we have 42 objects (values) in total order : 0 to 42, with a successor morphism defined between each object. For convenience we also embed the cocategory and the predecessor morphisms (cosuccessors)
Note : although they are not defined, the composition of these morphisms exist in this category, for it to be a category.
