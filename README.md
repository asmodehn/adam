Programming designed for machines

Bullet points in random order

- when machine can program, humans only need to be able to read/visualize the codefor it. It is a language for machine, more than it is for humans. humans only need to be able to understand it.
- if human eventually has to generate code, machine can refuse anything that is 'invalid syntax', so even the interface to program only allow valid construct.
- when both human and machine can write programs, while potentially representing two different semantics, there need to be a referential semantics. Math and category theory seems to be able to provide such a referential semantics,as well as a practical graphical representation.
